# Sample entry for /etc/remote on BSD systems for PostScript printer.
#
# If you want to "tip" to the printer to do system
# configuration, debugging, etc., use a "remote(5)"
# entry like the following.  To envoke the
# interactive PostScript interpreter, type "executive"
# once tip has made a connection (it will not echo,
# a typo will lead to a PostScript error); the printer
# will then start echoing and will support primitive 
# line-editing features like ^H (backspace), ^U (erase line)
# and ^R (retype line).
